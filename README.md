Building a personal portfolio website with HTML and CSS allows you to create a digital space that showcases your skills and experience.  HTML provides the framework, defining sections for your introduction, background, projects, and contact information. CSS then breathes life into this structure, transforming it into a visually compelling representation of you. You can use CSS to control the layout, fonts, colors, and images, creating a portfolio that reflects your unique personality and brand.  This combination of HTML and CSS lets you craft a professional and informative website that effectively presents yourself to potential clients or employers.
